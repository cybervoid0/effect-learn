Hey Effect community! 👋

I've created a comprehensive learning course for Effect with **47 progressive exercises** covering everything from basics to advanced patterns!

🎯 **What makes it unique:**
- Progressive structure (15 levels from beginner to advanced)
- Practical, test-driven exercises (not just reading!)
- Automated tests for instant feedback
- Reference solutions for each exercise
- Detailed explanations with examples and hints
- CLI tools for convenient learning

📚 **Topics covered:**
✅ Basics → Error Handling → Control Flow
✅ Concurrency → Resources → Services
✅ State Management → Streams → Observability
✅ And much more!

🚀 **Current status:**
- Levels 1-3 (9 exercises) are fully ready with detailed content
- Levels 4-15 have basic structure ready to fill

This is something I couldn't find anywhere else - a structured, hands-on course for learning Effect systematically. Think "Exercism for Effect"!

Would love to hear your feedback and contributions! 🙏

### Title:
"I created a comprehensive Effect-TS learning course with 47 progressive exercises"

### Body:

```markdown
Hey everyone!

I've been learning Effect (effect.website) and couldn't find a structured, hands-on course anywhere - not even from the creators. So I built one!

## What is it?

A progressive learning course with **47 exercises** divided into **15 levels**, covering all core Effect concepts through practical, test-driven assignments.

## What makes it different?

Unlike tutorials or documentation:
- ✅ You write real code, not just read examples
- ✅ Automated tests give instant feedback
- ✅ Reference solutions show best practices
- ✅ Progressive structure from basics to advanced

Think "Exercism" but specifically for Effect!

## Topics covered:

- Basics (creating, running, transforming)
- Error Handling (typed errors, fallback strategies)
- Control Flow (conditionals, loops, combining)
- Concurrency (Fibers, racing, parallel execution)
- Resource Management, Services, State Management
- Streams, Scheduling, Caching, Batching
- Observability (Logging, Metrics, Tracing)
- And more advanced patterns!

## Current Status:

- ✅ Levels 1-3 (9 exercises) fully ready with detailed content
- 📝 Levels 4-15 (38 exercises) have basic structure

## Links:

- GitHub: [your-repo-url]
- Effect website: https://effect.website/

Open to feedback and contributions! If you've been wanting to learn Effect but didn't know where to start, this might help.

Happy to answer any questions!

🚀 Excited to share my latest open-source project!

I've created a comprehensive learning course for Effect (Effect-TS) - a powerful TypeScript library for building robust applications.

The course includes:
📚 47 progressive exercises across 15 levels
✅ Automated tests for instant feedback
🎓 Reference solutions and detailed explanations
🛠️ CLI tools for convenient learning

This fills a gap I noticed while learning Effect - there was no structured, hands-on course available anywhere.

Topics covered:
• Basics → Error Handling → Control Flow
• Concurrency → Resources → Services
• State Management → Streams → Observability
• Advanced Patterns

Perfect for TypeScript developers interested in functional programming and building more reliable applications!

### Subject: Created a comprehensive Effect learning course

```
Hi Effect team,

I'm a big fan of Effect and have been using it in my projects. While learning, I noticed there wasn't a structured, hands-on course available - so I built one!

The course includes 47 progressive exercises covering all core Effect concepts, from basics to advanced patterns. Each exercise has:
- Detailed concept explanations
- Practical assignments
- Automated tests
- Reference solutions

I've completed the first 3 levels (Basics, Error Handling, Control Flow) with full content, and have the structure ready for the remaining 12 levels.

GitHub: [your-repo-url]

I'd love to:
1. Get your feedback
2. Potentially link it from the official docs as a learning resource
3. Collaborate on completing the remaining levels

The project is MIT licensed and open for contributions.

Would you be interested in reviewing it?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

3. **Engagement**: Respond to comments and feedback quickly
4. **Updates**: Share progress as you complete more levels
5. **Cross-post**: Share in multiple communities (Discord, Twitter, Reddit, Dev.to)

Good luck! 🚀
